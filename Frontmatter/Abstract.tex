This Master's Thesis presents the design and development of an analysis platform aimed to enhance crowd safety measurability at Roskilde Festival. The application addresses the limitations of current practices, which often rely on subjective assessments rather than objective data. The project presents a solution that utilizes video surveillance and AI to provide accurate insights into crowd dynamics, including: crowd density, ingress/egress counts, flow rates, and movement patterns. The system employs YOLO-based computer vision models for head detection and tracking, spatial mapping to translate pixel coordinates to geographic positions, and a user-friendly interface for data analysis and visualization. Technical evaluations demonstrate the system's capability, and a workshop with Roskilde Festival's safety team confirmed its business applicability.
