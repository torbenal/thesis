Thank you both for your support and interest throughout the past one and a half years. RF's Henrik Bondo Nielsen was Fluxense's first ever phone call, only few hours after the idea was conceived! We were met with intrigue and open arms, which gave us the confidence to further pursue our idea. I have gained a much deeper understanding of the important work you do, and have gained a great respect for crowd safety managers in general.
