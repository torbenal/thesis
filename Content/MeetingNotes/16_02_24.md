Mads Therkilsen is responsible for flow analysis, and early in researching how AI tools can help with crowd management. (feeding existing information about venues to the modelâ€¦.)

We will recieve contacts to people from england doing Crowd Science. Keith Still - mathematician with focus in this field.

Takeaway is - analysis is more important than real time insights
