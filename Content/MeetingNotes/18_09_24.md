**Agenda**:

Showcase the dashboard (cumulative total chart, ingress/egress chart)

**Notes**:

Nice visualization, only feedback on colour scheme

Morten can use the trends but not the absolute numbers, he wants to know what the error rate is, ho we validate it.

Bookers would LOVE this data

Morten wants a some highlights of the data that he can then use for making changes to the layout and staffing etc.

Overlay concerts from Gaia over this graph too
