Meeting with Mads Therkildsen.

Roskilde proposes our involvement at the festival to be composed of two phases. Pre-festival during warmup days they would like us to analyze EOS. After opening of the big festival, Arena stage. We are open and flexible to analyze also other parts of the venue, maybe areas with Food and Beverages.

Mads asks to be sent the project description, and to understand better what our aims with the product are. Ideally in the future, we are coming, setting up cameras, taking them down and just giving a report on the analyzed areas, with minimum work effort needed from the organizers side.

The expectation is to get data/demand curves for the ingress ang egress of people to the individual stages. Secondarily, to get relatively accurate measurements into what the density of crowds is in the analyzed zones that follow Fruins levels of service. Estimate density based in people pr. m2 etc.

It is interesting for Roskilde to get an idea about how a concert starting at Orange stage affects people moving from Arena to other areas.

Our contact people at Roskilde for the beginning will be Niels - working with CCTV systems and Adam from England who is a flow manager. We will setup a way to follow and learn from Adam while on ground working to understand the way they handle things.

We will receive risk assessments and concert schedules to understand key events.
