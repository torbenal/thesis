Agreed on data exchange - week between 16th and 20th of September. Follow up meeting regarding progress to be agreed in October.

Soft milestones :

- 14th October - WIP Mockup for ingress/egress
- 25th November - Ingress/egress visualization in user-friendly platform and WIP mockup of crowd flow visualizations
- 20th January - Flow visualization in user-friendly platform integrated

RF is interested in seeing visualizations of direction of flow. Crossflow and density is bad for sales and influences their decisions when planning the placement of bars etc. We will ask for contact to a BI officer at RF to understand more how this data can be used in other wars than only crowd safety planning.

Key questions crowd officers ask: Do we have enough time to move people from one area to another? Low flow means higher densities. Direction of flow is important because they want to know where do people come from.

While they can use time to look at CCTV videos, it is more valuable for them to have a user friendly data based interface that can be understood across the entire organization. They could use the data in a broader sense to place bars, information screens, update their risk assessments, booker assessments of the attraction of the individual concerts.
