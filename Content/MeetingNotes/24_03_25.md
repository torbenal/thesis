**Flow**

- Mads likes the overview, it’s much more intuitive. He feels the numbers are more useful
- They estimate flow to calculate how many meters are needed for proper ingress/egress
- This helps document that space was properly allocated, or if it was too narrow
- Would like to see flow separated for each entrance/camera
- Based on his intuition, the numbers look very realistic

- Would like to know the load of each entrance
- Flow chart should be able to filter based on entrance/camera, but also show them aggregated

**Density**

- Chosen bins for heatmap are alright, but they use Levels of Service internally, Mads sends a document

- This tool helps communicated internally in other departments
- Other departments dont understand crowd safety’s recommendations
